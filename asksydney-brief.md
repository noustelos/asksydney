# BRIEF — asksydney.ai landing page

Reproduce the **asksingapore.ai** landing page for **asksydney.ai** — same architecture, structure,
behaviour and commercial purpose; **new aesthetic to be decided inside the new project**.
Structural reference: `~/Desktop/askSingapore/index.html` (1,027 lines, single file — read it before building).

---

## 1. What this page is

- A **design-only, domain-for-sale landing page** for `asksydney.ai`, third property in the
  Noustelos Studio "Ask" network (asksantorini.ai → asksingapore.ai → asksydney.ai).
- **One file: `index.html`.** Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. No frameworks, no build step, no backend,
  no dependencies, no asset files (favicon and decorative art are inline SVG/data-URIs).
- The chat is a **SCRIPTED DEMO**: four hardcoded Q→A pairs matching the category chips play a
  typing-dots + word-by-word reveal; any other input gets a fallback line. Zero AI, zero network —
  a real backend may replace the scripted map later, so the wiring hooks (§7) must stay in place.
- **Commercial goal: sell the domain.** The `.acquire` pill above the topbar is the primary
  conversion point.

### Honesty rule (non-negotiable)
The demo must never fake live-AI signals:
- A bold `.caption` under the category chips discloses the scripted demo and links to the live
  concierge at **asksantorini.ai**. This is the only disclosure line — no separate `.disclaimer`.
- The chat-window status label reads **"Live Demo · Ask Sydney AI"** — "Live Demo", not "Live".
- The weather line is a static mockup (placeholder `id`, no fake "live" framing beyond the design).

## 2. Decided parameters (locked before this brief)

| Item | Decision |
|---|---|
| Acquisition contact | `mailto:info@asksantorini.ai?subject=Acquisition enquiry — asksydney.ai` (plain mailto, **no forms**; switch to `info@asksydney.ai` once that mailbox exists) |
| Sister links | Footer: **"Sister concierges · asksantorini.ai · asksingapore.ai"** (both). Demo-disclosure caption links to **asksantorini.ai** only (it is the live concierge). |
| Studio mark | Bottom-left, links to **noustelos.gr** |
| Chip categories | Same four, localized: **Restaurants / Hotels / Car rental / Directions** |
| Deploy | New GitHub repo (e.g. `askSydney`) → **Cloudflare Pages, git-connected**, custom domain `asksydney.ai`, push to `main` = instant live |
| Aesthetic | **Open — decided in the new project.** Keep the token *architecture* (§4), swap the values. |

## 3. Page anatomy (reproduce 1:1)

One `<section class="hero">` (min-height 100vh) with three layers:

**Layer 1 — ambient decoration** (`.deco-*`, `aria-hidden`, `pointer-events: none`):
- `.deco-grove`-equivalent: ONE signature piece of thin line-art inline SVG anchored bottom-left
  (Singapore uses the Supertree Grove, ~50 lines of SVG paths at stroke-opacity 0.11–0.45).
  Sydney motif candidates — decide with the aesthetic: Opera House sails, Harbour Bridge arch,
  Norfolk pines. Static, no animation; recedes on mobile (`width: 80vw; opacity: ~0.45`).
- `.deco-weave`: full-bleed adaptive theme layer, transparent by default (`opacity: 0`,
  `transition: opacity .55s`). Query keywords dissolve a faint pattern in at **opacity 0.05**
  (Singapore: leaf texture for "nature", woven pinstripe for "luxury" — both as data-URI SVG /
  repeating-linear-gradient). Sydney themes TBD with aesthetic (e.g. beach/surf, harbour, luxury).

**Layer 2 — `.inner`** (max-width 1340px, flex column), top to bottom:
1. `.acquire` pill — centered above the topbar. Uppercase tracked microcopy:
   *"Premium domain available for acquisition · Enquire →"* with a small diamond glyph.
   Quiet CTA-red **outline at rest, fills solid on hover**. This is one of only two places the
   reserved CTA color appears.
2. `.topbar` — left: brand (circular `.mark` containing a rotated-45° gradient `.diamond` +
   `ASKSYDNEY` wordmark in gradient text with the `.AI` tld in the accent color); right: the
   live-clock lockup (§5).
3. `.main` → `.hero-row` (flex, **non-wrapping** above 760px):
   - `.hero-left`: eyebrow *"Sydney · AI Concierge"* → giant display title **"Just / Ask"**
     (serif, `clamp(84px, 13.5vw, 176px)`, line-height 0.9, "Ask" in the accent color) →
     `.effortless` card (fit-content white panel: pip + "EFFORTLESS" label,
     *"No app. No sign-up. Just answers."*).
   - `.hero-right` (flex-basis ~414px): the chat mock (§6).
4. `.closing` — centered: italic serif guide line *"your Sydney AI travel guide."*, a lede
   (*"Restaurants, hotels, car rentals and live directions — instant local answers, without the
   noise."*), and an italic tagline (*"Your AI concierge, made for Sydney, in your pocket — ready
   any time, any day."*).
5. `.foot` — hairline + *"Sister concierges · [asksantorini.ai] · [asksingapore.ai]"* (uppercase
   tracked, links in accent color).

**Layer 3 — floating anchors** (absolute, z-index 3):
- `.cta-pill` bottom-right: white pill "Ask Sydney AI" with a ring+diamond icon; on click focuses
  the chat input (placeholder hook `#cta-ask`).
- `.studio-mark` bottom-left: "NOUSTELOS STUDIO" → noustelos.gr; on ≤760px it leaves the float and
  joins the flow under the footer (`margin: 6px auto 58px` to clear the CTA pill).

### `<head>` (the link preview IS the sales pitch)
- `<title>ASKSYDNEY.AI — Just Ask</title>`; meta description ending in
  *"Premium domain available for acquisition."*
- Canonical `https://asksydney.ai/`, `theme-color` = page background, full OG + Twitter
  summary-card set (og:site_name, og:title, og:description mirroring the meta description).
- Inline SVG favicon as a data-URI: the diamond brand mark on the accent color (no asset file).
- JSON-LD `WebSite` block: *"Sydney AI concierge — premium domain available for acquisition."*
- Google Fonts `<link>` (preconnect ×2 + one stylesheet): one display serif + one UI grotesque —
  **families TBD with the aesthetic** (Singapore uses Newsreader + Hanken Grotesk).

---

## 4. Styling system — keep the architecture, swap the values

All design decisions live as CSS custom properties in `:root`; **never hardcode colors at call
sites**. The token *shape* to reproduce (values are the new project's aesthetic decision):

- `--paper` (page field) and `--ink` (body text) — the neutral pair.
- One **accent family** (`--jade`/`--jade-deep` in Singapore) — brand mark, links, live dots,
  focus rings, decorative art.
- One **reserved CTA color** (`--vermilion` in Singapore) — used at EXACTLY two conversion
  points: the Send button and the acquisition pill. **Nowhere else.** This scarcity is the
  page's conversion logic — preserve it whatever the new palette is.
- `--mist` (soft surface/divider tint), derived alpha tints (`--ink-70/55/40`, `--ink-line`,
  `--accent-line`, `--accent-tint`), `--hero-bg` (paper base + two faint accent radial washes
  from opposite corners), gradients: `--diamond-grad`, `--wordmark-grad`, `--send-grad(+hover)`.
- `--font-display` / `--font-ui`.

### Motion & a11y rules (carry over verbatim)
- All keyframes prefixed and defined at the top of `<style>`: living-logo shimmer/pulse,
  Send glow + spark sweep, live-dot pulse, typing dots, and `scRise` staged entrance
  (acquire → topbar → hero-left → hero-right → closing → foot → cta/studio, delays .08s–.66s).
- **No continuous full-surface animations, no `backdrop-filter`** — stays light on old machines.
- One `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` block gates ALL motion; extend it for any new
  animation. Exception: the word-by-word streaming **still plays** under reduced motion
  (it's content presentation) — only dots, smooth-scroll and decorative animation drop.
- Global accent `:focus-visible` outline; the chat input row carries its ring via
  `:focus-within` (the field itself suppresses `outline`).
- Layout is **non-wrapping by design**; a single `@media (max-width: 760px)` fallback stacks the
  hero row, relaxes letter-spacing on tracked caps, wraps chips to 2×2, fades the deco art.

## 5. Live Sydney clock (topbar right)

Computed locally with `Intl.DateTimeFormat({ timeZone: 'Australia/Sydney' })`, refreshed every
15s — no network. Editorial lockup, top to bottom:
1. `.clock-date` — accent-colored tracked caps date line (e.g. "Sun, 06 Jul 2026").
2. `.clock-time` — large light-weight `HH<span class="cc">:</span>MM` numeral, tabular nums,
   dimmed watch-style colon.
3. `.clock-meta` — pulsing live dot · **timezone label** · availability tagline.
   ⚠️ Sydney has DST (AEST/AEDT). Don't hardcode "AEST": derive the label with
   `timeZoneName: 'short'` from the same formatter, or use a static neutral "SYD".
   Availability copy: Singapore says "24/7 Islandwide Availability" — Sydney needs its own
   (e.g. "24/7 Harbourside Availability"); decide with the copy pass.
4. `.clock-weather` — **static mockup** weather line with placeholder id (`#syd-temp`),
   e.g. `22°C · Mostly Sunny` (winter in July!), marked `TODO: wire to live data later`.

---

## 6. Chat mock — structure & scripted behaviour

**Structure:** `.chat-frame` (1px gradient-border wrapper + soft double drop-shadow so the card
floats) → `.chat` (white, radius 27px) containing:
header (pulsing live dot + "LIVE DEMO · ASK SYDNEY AI" + two icon buttons: refresh ⟳ and a
diamond "more") → intro (`.chat-title` serif: *"AI Sydney Concierge. / Instant local answers,
without the noise."* + three pip bullets: *"Start with your area," / "your mood," / "or what you
need right now."*) → gradient hairline divider → `#chat-log` (nested scroll, max-height 300px,
thin accent scrollbar, `overscroll-behavior: contain`; greeting is the first bot bubble:
*"Hi! I'm your local Sydney AI. Ask me anything."*) → `.chips` row (4 buttons with
`data-prefill`) → disclosure `.caption` → `.input-row` (pill: input + vermilion-family Send).

Bubbles: bot rows carry a small avatar (ring + diamond) and a mist bubble with radius
`4px 16px 16px 16px`; user rows right-aligned, one-step-deeper mist, mirrored radius, max-width 85%.

**Behaviour (inline `<script>`, IIFE, zero network):**
- `SCRIPTED` array of 4 `{q, a}` pairs + `FALLBACK` string. Matching: normalized
  (trim/collapse-whitespace/lowercase) exact equality with the prefill questions.
- `submitQuery()`: guard on empty/`busy` → spark the Send → append user bubble → clear input →
  `respond()`.
- `respond()`: `busy = true`; typing-dots bubble ~800ms → swap to empty bubble →
  `revealAnswer()` streams word-by-word at **45ms/word** (one `<span class="w">` per word,
  opacity-only fade; forced reflow before adding `.in`; keep scroll pinned to tail) →
  `busy = false`. Under reduced motion: skip dots and smooth scroll, stream at **30ms/word**
  with instant pop.
- Send button: `.is-ready` glow whenever input has text; `.spark` sweep replayed via
  remove-class → force reflow → add-class, cleared on `animationend`. Empty-input click:
  spark only. Enter mirrors Send.
- Chips: prefill input, focus it, refresh send state, apply theme, then **auto-send after
  300ms unless `busy`** (if busy, the prefill just waits in the field).
- Adaptive background: `THEMES` array of `{name, re}` keyword regexes → `detectTheme()` on every
  input event → `applyTheme()` swaps a `theme-*` class on `.hero` with a 280ms `weave-shift`
  fade-out/in dissolve. Keep the mechanism; Sydney keyword→theme maps TBD with aesthetic.
- Floating CTA click → `input.focus()`.

### Scripted content to write (Sydney copy pass, same voice as Singapore)
Four Q→A pairs, exactly matching the chip prefills. Answers: 60–90 words, warm concierge tone,
2–3 concrete *named* local options spanning price/mood range, always ending with a follow-up
question. Suggested prefills (finalize in the new project):
- Restaurants → "Where should I eat tonight near Circular Quay?"
- Hotels → "Find me a boutique hotel in Surry Hills."
- Car rental → "Rent a car for a Blue Mountains day trip tomorrow."
- Directions → "Directions to the Sydney Opera House."
`FALLBACK` mirrors Singapore's: honest "this is a preview" + nudge to the chips + acquisition hint.
The input placeholder: "Where to eat tonight?" (or Sydney flavour).

---

## 7. Backend wiring hooks — keep these in place, exactly

`#ask-input` (chat input) · `#ask-send` (Send) · `#cta-ask` (floating CTA) ·
`.chip[data-prefill]` (chips) · `#syd-temp` (weather placeholder) · `#chat-log`.
A future backend replaces only `SCRIPTED` + `respond()`; everything else stays.

---

## 8. Repo & deploy

1. New folder/repo (suggested: `~/Desktop/askSydney`): `index.html`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`,
   `.gitignore`. Write CLAUDE.md in the same shape as askSingapore's (what-this-is, honesty rule,
   deploy warning, architecture, tokens, hooks). **Keep the README truthful** — askSingapore's
   README still describes an old discarded aesthetic; don't repeat that drift.
2. GitHub repo → Cloudflare Pages, git-connected, custom domain `asksydney.ai`.
   ⚠️ Push to `main` = **instant live**. Work on branches, merge deliberately.
   After every push, **verify the deployment actually landed** (Pages dashboard) — the
   askSingapore webhook once died silently and needed a repo reconnect in the dashboard.
   Rollback = revert commit + push, or dashboard rollback.

## 9. Explicitly open (decide in the new project)

- Entire aesthetic: palette values, the two font families, the signature deco motif and the
  weave theme patterns/keywords, design-language name (Singapore's is "Garden City Precision").
- Final wording of the 4 Q→A pairs, fallback, availability tagline, weather mockup values.
- Whether the wordmark tracking/size needs tuning ("ASKSYDNEY" is 9 characters vs
  "ASKSINGAPORE" at 12 — the topbar will breathe differently).
